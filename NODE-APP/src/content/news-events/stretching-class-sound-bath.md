## Join us for our first ever fusion of stretching + sound healing + reiki!
Lori will begin by bringing everyone through her Science of Stretching class (45 minutes). Participants will sink into stretches as a group, allowing the body and mind to relax.
Next, Xiao will perform a healing sound bath with crystal healing bowls, tuning forks, and other healing instruments (45 minutes).
During the sound bath, Amanda will make her way around the room performing reiki on participants to infuse extra healing energy & relaxation into this experience.
## What to bring?
Please bring a yoga mat if you have one. You may also want to bring a blanket to get cozy during the sound healing portion of the event. Any other comfort items such as a pillow may be used, but we have extras at the clinic if needed.
