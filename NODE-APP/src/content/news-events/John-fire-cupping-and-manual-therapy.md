## Fire Cupping and Manual Therapy with Physical Therapist
Physical therapist, John Waller, is offering a manual therapy session, that includes the following modalities: fire cupping, dry needling, stretching, joint mobilization, and/or instrument-assited soft tissue mobilization, similar to gua sha or scraping. Some modalities may not be appropriate for every patient. The physical therapist will assess your issue and pick the safest and most effective modalities for you based on your health history and current symptoms.

<br />These techniques can: 
<br />-Help relieve chronic or acute pain
<br />-Improve blood flow and local circulation
<br />-Reduce joint stiffness and improve overall mobility
<br />-Improve neuromotor function
<br />-Reduce inflammation
<br />-Relieve tension associated with trigger points or scar adhesions

Cost is $55 for a 30 minute session. The shorter duration and lower cost allows patients to come in more frequently to improve their symptoms or to enhance athletic performance.
