## Craniosacral Therapy now available at Yin Yang House
Amanda Osborne, LMT received her training from the Upledger Institute, which for over 40 years has trained therapists all over the world in Craniosacral therapy (CST). CST is a gentle, hands-on method of evaluating and enhancing the functioning of a physiological body system called the craniosacral system - comprised of the membranes and cerebrospinal fluid that surround and protect the brain and spinal cord. Using a soft touch, practitioners release restrictions in the craniosacral system, which has been shown to improve the functioning of the central nervous system, as well as many other systems of the body, such as digestive, musculoskeletal, respiratory, circulatory, and more. CST has also been shown to help with the physical components related to such somatic conditions as post traumatic stress, depression, and anxiety.
## What does a session look like?
CST sessions are 1 hour long and cost $90, or included in your 4-pack or 8-pack for a discount. The client is fully-clothed on a massage table while receiving this treatment. This is a deeply relaxing service, with many people reaching deep states of calm or even sleep.
