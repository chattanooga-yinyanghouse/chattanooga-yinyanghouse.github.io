## Reflexology Session with Emily, LMT
Reflexology is a therapeutic foot treatment that applies pressure to specific points believed to correspond with different organs and systems of the body. This holistic technique promotes relaxation, improves circulation, reduces stress, and supports overall well-being, helping you feel balanced and revitalized from head to toe. Your service will include hot stones and towels with massage to begin, then a reflexology application to stimulate various zones within the body with focused work as desired. The session is 45 minutes long and is $80.
