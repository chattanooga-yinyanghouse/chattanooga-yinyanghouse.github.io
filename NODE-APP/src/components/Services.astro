    title: 'Lymphatic Drainage', 
    description: `<ul class="m-3"><li class="list-disc">Manual Lymphatic Drainage (Vodder method) is a gentle and effective hands-on technique to encourage excess fluid, metabolic waste, allergens, bacteria/viruses, etc to exit the body through the lymphatic system, while optimizing the immune system. Congestion of the lymph fluid in the body can happen due to trauma (physical and/or emotional), surgery, cancer treatments, chronic disease, infections, poor lifestyle habits, genetic factors, and environmental toxins.</li><li class="list-disc">Electro-Lymphatic Therapy (also called Assisted Lymphatic Therapy) uses the principles of the Vodder method to more deeply stimulate the lymphatics by means of an instrument that is glided along the skin, transmitting electrical, light, and vibrational frequencies to thin the lymph fluid and break-up congested areas. This makes it easier for the lymphatic vessels to absorb and eliminate from the body.</li></ul>`

    description: `<ul class="m-3"><li class="list-disc">After plastic surgery or orthopedic surgery, manual lymphatic drainage is helpful at reducing swelling, bruising, and inflammation. The Vodder method of MLD is very gentle and uses the stretch of the skin along with light pumping motions to move fluid out of the tissue space and back into the lymph system so your body can eliminate excess fluid and waste. After the incisions have healed, different techniques will be incorporated to address scar tissue, mobility, and pain.</li></ul>`
